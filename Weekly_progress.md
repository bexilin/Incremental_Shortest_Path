# Week 1 (10/24-10/30)

Made the general implementation plan, wrote the c++ header files that define data structures the generate test data and build a map representaion. 

# Week 2 (10/31-11/6)

Wrote class methods for the data generator and map builder, and a CMakelist.txt file to organize the project code structure.

# Week 3 (11/7-11/13)

Implement Floyd Warshall solver, and wrote a python script to visualize the map and shortest path solutions.

# Week 4 (11/14-11/20)

Implement an incremental solver from paper (Ramalingam, Ganesan, and Thomas Reps. "On the computational complexity of dynamic graph problems." Theoretical Computer Science 158.1-2 (1996): 233-277.), revise data generator to allow change of flight price in part of the map
